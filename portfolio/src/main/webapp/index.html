      <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio:)!</h1>
      <p>My name is Susana Perez<p> 
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <img src="images/download.png" alt="Front facing picture of a woman" style="height:600px;"/>
      <p> I am a CS student at the University of Texas at El Paso. I just finished my first year and
          I am a Google STEP intern this summer!
          I am always trying to improve my technical abilities and I love meeting and working with 
          new people because I always get to learn something different.</p>
      <h2> Cool projects I've worked on</h2>
       <p>I like to attend Hackathons since I get to gain experience on the field, create cool projects, and work with different people.
          My favorite project I've worked on was the prototype of an app that teaches financial education to college students. 
          The app has a pet companion that keeps track of the user's expenses and analyzes them to offer financial tips
          and ways to reduce monthly expenses.</p>
      <h2> Pictures!</h2>
      <img src="images/GoogleOffice.jpg" alt="Picture of a building" style="width:500px;height:600px;"/>
      <p> Last January I visited Google's Playa Vista Office in California.</p>
      <img src="images/marinaDelRey.jpg" alt="Person on a pier" style="width:500px"/>
      <p> I was there for a just a couple of days but I had a lot of fun, this is me visiting Marina del Rey's pier.</p>
      <img src="images/beach.jpg" alt="Sunset at sea" style="width:500px"/> 
      <p> I took this picture on my last day in California, I really enjoyed seeing the waves and the orange color of the sky.</p>
