      <p>My name is Susana Perez<p> 
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p> I am a CS student at the University of Texas at El Paso. I just finished my first year and
          I am a Google STEP intern this summer!
          I am always trying to improve my technical abilities and I love meeting and working with 
          new people because I always get to learn something different.</p>
