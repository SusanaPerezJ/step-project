      <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio:)!</h1>
      <p>My name is Susana Perez<p> 
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p> I am a CS student at the University of Texas at El Paso. I just finished my first year and
          I am a Google STEP intern this summer!
          I am always trying to improve my technical abilities and I love meeting and working with 
          new people because I always get to learn something different.</p>
      <h2> Cool projects I've worked on</h2>
       <p>I like to attend Hackathons since I get to gain experience on the field, create cool projects, and work with different people.
          My favorite project I've worked on was the prototype of an app that teaches financial education to college students. 
          The app has a pet companion that keeps track of the user's expenses and analyzes them to offer financial tips
          and ways to reduce monthly expenses.</p>
